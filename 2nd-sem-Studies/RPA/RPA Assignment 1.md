# Levels of RPA

## a. Levels of RPA

Robotic Process Automation (RPA) can be categorized into different levels based on its complexity, capabilities, and application. The levels of RPA include:

### 1. Basic RPA (Task Automation)

Basic RPA, also known as task automation, focuses on automating simple and repetitive tasks that do not require decision-making. These tasks follow predefined rules and involve structured data processing. Basic RPA is commonly used to reduce manual work and improve efficiency in data entry, report generation, and transactional processes.

**Example:** Copying data from an Excel sheet into an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system or generating routine reports.

### 2. Enhanced RPA (Process Automation)

Enhanced RPA, or process automation, takes automation to the next level by integrating with multiple applications and systems. It automates complete workflows instead of just individual tasks. This level of RPA is particularly useful in automating business processes that involve structured data, decision-making rules, and human intervention at critical points.

**Example:** Automating the invoice processing system, where RPA bots extract invoice details, validate them against purchase orders, and update the financial records.

### 3. Intelligent RPA (Cognitive Automation)

Intelligent RPA, or cognitive automation, incorporates artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), natural language processing (NLP), and other advanced technologies to handle unstructured data, recognize patterns, and make decisions. Unlike basic and enhanced RPA, intelligent automation enables bots to learn from experience and improve over time.

**Example:** Chatbots that understand and respond to customer queries using NLP or intelligent document processing using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to extract text from scanned documents.

## b. Evolution of RPA

The evolution of RPA has occurred over several decades, adapting to the needs of businesses and technological advancements. The key phases include:

### 1. Early Automation (1990s - Early 2000s)

The first phase of automation involved basic scripting, macros, and workflow automation tools. Organizations used these to automate simple and repetitive tasks such as data entry, form filling, and report generation. These tools required significant human intervention for monitoring and maintenance.

### 2. Rule-Based Automation (Mid-2000s - 2010s)

The next phase introduced dedicated RPA software that could mimic human actions such as mouse clicks, keystrokes, and data extraction from multiple applications. This rule-based automation became popular in industries like banking, finance, and healthcare, where compliance and efficiency were critical.

### 3. Cognitive Automation (2010s - Present)

With advancements in AI and ML, RPA evolved to incorporate intelligent automation capabilities. Bots were now able to process unstructured data, perform predictive analysis, and make context-based decisions. This phase saw the integration of AI-driven automation in areas such as customer support, fraud detection, and document processing.

### 4. Hyperautomation (Future of RPA)

The future of RPA lies in hyperautomation, where organizations leverage a combination of RPA, AI, process mining, and low-code platforms to achieve full-scale digital transformation. Hyperautomation focuses on end-to-end automation and continuous improvement of business processes.

# RPA Implementation Cycle

The **RPA implementation cycle** follows a structured approach to ensure smooth deployment and effective automation. The key steps include:

### 1. Identify the Process for Automation

Organizations must identify tasks or processes that are repetitive, rule-based, and require significant manual effort. High-volume, standardized tasks with minimal human judgment are ideal candidates for automation.

**Example:** Payroll management, invoice processing, employee onboarding.

### 2. Feasibility Analysis

Before implementing RPA, organizations conduct a feasibility analysis to assess technical, operational, and financial viability. Factors such as process complexity, system compatibility, and expected return on investment (ROI) are considered.

### 3. Process Design & Mapping

A detailed workflow is created to map the existing manual process and define automation steps. This includes identifying decision points, exceptions, dependencies, and integrations with other systems.

### 4. Bot Development

RPA bots are developed using tools such as UiPath, Automation Anywhere, or Blue Prism. Developers configure bots to execute specific tasks, such as data extraction, validation, and processing, using scripts and predefined rules.

### 5. Testing & Validation

Before deploying bots in production, rigorous testing is conducted, including unit testing, integration testing, and user acceptance testing (UAT). This ensures that the automation meets accuracy, efficiency, and compliance requirements.

### 6. Deployment & Monitoring

Once validated, bots are deployed in a live environment. Continuous monitoring is essential to track bot performance, identify issues, and optimize execution.

### 7. Optimization & Scaling

Organizations continuously improve bot performance based on operational insights. Once successful, RPA implementation is scaled to other processes, expanding automation benefits.

# Six Sigma and Lean in RPA

## What is Six Sigma?

Six Sigma is a data-driven methodology focused on reducing defects and improving process efficiency. It uses the **DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control)** approach to optimize workflows and minimize errors.

**Application in RPA:**

- Ensures automation processes are accurate and free of errors.
- Helps measure and control performance using statistical analysis.
- Reduces manual errors and improves operational efficiency.

## What is Lean?

Lean methodology aims to eliminate waste, optimize resources, and improve workflow efficiency. It focuses on reducing unnecessary steps in a process to enhance productivity.

**Application in RPA:**

- Helps identify the right processes for automation.
- Streamlines workflows before implementing RPA.
- Ensures bots operate efficiently without redundant steps.

## Implementation of Six Sigma and Lean in RPA

1. **Process Optimization** – Analyzing workflows before automation to remove inefficiencies.
2. **Error Reduction** – Implementing Six Sigma techniques to reduce defects in automation.
3. **Performance Measurement** – Using Six Sigma metrics such as **Defects Per Million Opportunities (DPMO)**.
4. **Continuous Improvement** – Regularly monitoring and refining automated processes.
